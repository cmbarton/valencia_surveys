Image Analysis Using NIH Image on Aerial PhotosImage is aerial photo using 256 shades of greyImage preparation: 1. Register image in MapInfo.2. Import into NIH Image for processingIdentify erosion1. Change to thresholding (group all shades above and below a particular pixel value)2. Set threshold at value of 20 (i.e., the whitest eroded areas)3. Invert image to make eroded areas black (for image manipulation)Smooth eroded areas1. Perform dialate on image 2 times2. Perform close on image 2 timesPrepare image for export1. Minimize colors (to reduce file size)2. Save as pictMake available to MapInfo1. Rename processed image of erosion to match name of originally registered image2. Open in MapInfo3. Trace outline of eroded areas to create erosion polygonsMapInfo files for sheet erosionEROSIONPolygons of areas of significant sheet erosion (indicated by white marls on aerial photos). EROSION has the following fields: erosion_factor: Polygons bounding nearly solid white areas have an erosion factor of 1.00; polygons bounding mostly solid white areas (but with some less eroded areas) have an erosion factor of 0.75; polygons bounding patchy areas about half white, half grey have an erosion factor of 0.50; polygons bounding patchy areas that are mostly grey, but with many small white patches have an erosion factor of 0.25SUBSECT_EROSIONPolygons of areas of significant sheet erosion WITHIN each subsector surveyed. EROSION map overlayed and cut by the SUBSECTOR map. SUBSECT_EROSION has the following fields:prov: The ID of the subsector within which each erosion polygon fallserosion_factor: same as for EROSIONarea: area (sq. km) of the polygonarea_wtd: area (sq. km) of the polygon times erosion_factor for that polygon (area_wtd = area * erosion_factor)
